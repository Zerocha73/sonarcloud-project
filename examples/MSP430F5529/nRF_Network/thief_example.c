/**
 * NRF24 Network Example
 *
 * This example demonstrates very basic use of the NRF Network on the MSP430.
 * The example uses two radios both connected to a single MSP430.  Due to the size
 * of the nrf24_network layer, the required program space will exceed the code-size
 * limited license of most Code Composer Studio installations.  To use this project,
 * you must either:
 *
 * 1) Have a full featured license
 * 2) Acquire a 90-day full featured evaluation license
 * 3) Switch compilers to use the GCC compiler
 *
 * Likely the best option for most users is to switch to the GCC compiler due to the
 * expensive full license and time-limit on the evaluation license.  For information
 * on switching to the GCC compiler, refer to the other documentation in this library
 *
 * In this example, the network is configured and some simple messages are sent between the two nodes.
 * The first node is configured using the default network built into the network layer.  The second node
 * requires that the user interface with the extended functionality of the network layer.  For most use cases,
 * there will only be one node on a single uC and therefore, the extended functionality is not needed.  See documentation
 * for the nrf network layer and inline comments below for more information about the extended functionality.
 *
 * The first node, using the default network built into the network layer, is configured using the THIS_NODE macro found in
 * system.h  You must always define this macro in the system.h file to use the network layer. In this example, we want the
 * first node to be a branch (Meaning it has a parent (the THIS_NODE2) and children). Most users on a network will be configured
 * as either a leaf or a branch, since only one user can be configured as a THIS_NODE2.
 *
 * The second node, using the extended functionality, is setup to be the THIS_NODE2 of the network.
 *
 * The first node (the branch) sets up a message handler to listen for TEST_MSG's, while the second node (the THIS_NODE2) sets
 * up a message handler to listen for TEST_MSG's.  (TEST_MSG and TEST_MSG were arbitrarily chosen and do not implement any of the
 * functionality of those application layers)
 *
 * A periodic task is setup to send a TEST_MSG to THIS_NODE from the THIS_NODE2.  The THIS_NODE node has a listener configured to handle
 * reception of TEST_MSG.  In the handler, the received message is simply printed over UART1.  In addition, the THIS_NODE node, in turn,
 * writes a TEST_MSG back to the THIS_NODE2.  Remember this is for demonstration purposes only.  Typically the THIS_NODE2 and branch nodes would
 * both have message handlers for the same type of system and the THIS_NODE node would just respond with the same message type.
 *
 * When the THIS_NODE2 receives the TEST_MSG, the handler is called and the received message is simply printed to the terminal over UART1.
 *
 * Be sure to read the inline comments below to get a better understanding of how to implement applications using the network layer.
 *
 * To test this example, simply run the program with a terminal setup on UART1 and look for
 *
 * Test Message!
 * Test Message Response!
